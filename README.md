# flx
Fast, character-based search library in Rust

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/flx)

Inspired by [flx for emacs](https://github.com/lewang/flx), uses the same basic algorithm.

This is basically the search function in BIS in a separate library. It works somewhat decently for bash history.

To use:
```toml
flx = "0.1"
```
